## **Section_1:_Planning**

### **Initial Ideas**

Below is a list of possible project ideas, and a list of pros/cons for each to help us reach a consensus on which project idea would be the best fit for us. 
* GPS Tracker on a Balloon
    * Pros: 
    * Cons: 
* Some sort of Projectile Launcher
    * Pros: Easy to Test, not expensive, no forseeable insane-level code
    * Cons: Difficult to Build

### Choice_of_Project

**PID Steered Flyer**:We are going to make an flyer that is powered by a motor, and uses PID to stay stable. We will use the Rasberry-Pi to collect the tilt data.

**Why**: The airplane will be complicated because we are putting individual aspects of engineering we've learned, together. We chose this project because we are applying what we've learned in our engineering courses to build something really cool.

### Research

### Important_Resources
[Crash Avoidence Light + Power](https://github.com/sechen12/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Crash_Avoidance_Light%20%2B%20Power.py) - Code for the calculating the tilt with an MPU, and the Pico sending an output depending on the conditions.

[Data Storage](https://github.com/sechen12/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Data_Storage) - Code for storing the data

### Schedule 
[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/month/2023/12/1?pli=1)

### Materials
**Hardware:**
- 9gr Micro servos
- 5gr Micro servo
- 18650 3.7V Battery
- 18650 Charger

**Non-electronics:**
- 5mm kraft foam board
- 3mm insulation foam
- 2mm balsa sheet
- 108mm Propellers (CW&CCW)
- Hot melt Glue Gun
- Cable Tie
- 1.2mm Pushrods
- Servo control horn
### Success_Statement

The project will be considered a success if the flyer is turned on with a switch and will store the tilt data onto the Pico so that it can be presented on the computer. An extra bonus will be having the flyer be controlled with PID so that it can hopefully remain in flight for an extended amount on time.
