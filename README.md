### **Initial Ideas**

Below is a list of possible project ideas, and a list of pros/cons for each to help us reach a consensus on which project idea would be the best fit for us. 
* GPS Tracker on a Balloon
    * Pros: 
    * Cons: 
* Some sort of Projectile Launcher
    * Pros: Easy to Test, not expensive, no forseeable insane-level code
    * Cons: Difficult to Build

### Choice_of_Project

**PID Steered Flyer**:We are going to make an flyer that is powered by a motor, and uses PID to stay stable. We will use the Rasberry-Pi to collect the tilt data.

**Why**: The airplane will be complicated because we are putting individual aspects of engineering we've learned, together. We chose this project because we are applying what we've learned in our engineering courses to build something really cool.
